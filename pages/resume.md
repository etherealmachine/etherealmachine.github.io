### Software Engineer @ Google, Inc. <small>2012 - 2014</small>

On the team responsible for scaling Google support for millions of customers. Systems include:

*	Web-based agent-facing customer support/relations portals (i.e. CRMs). Primarily written using an AngularJS frontend and Go-based backend with NoSQL-like databases.
*	PubSub based automated processing related to order management, automated robot-customer interactions, and batch processing jobs.
*	Internal auditing, authentication, and authorization of customer support requests.

### Lead Programmer @ LEEPS Lab <small>2007 - 2012</small>

*	Published two Open Source frameworks for Experimental Economics
*	Pettit, Friedman, Kephart, and Oprea. "Software for continuous game experiments". Experimental Economics Vol. 17, Issue 4.
	*	A Java-based framework with a plugin architecture based on dynamic class loading.
	*	Allowed rapid prototyping and completion of experiments running under soft real-time constraints in a multi-user networked environment.
